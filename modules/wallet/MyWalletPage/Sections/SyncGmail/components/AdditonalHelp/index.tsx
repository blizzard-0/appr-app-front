      How syncing your Gmail account works
    </h2>
    <p className="text-gray-800 text-base leading-snug mb-5">
      Sync your Gmail account connects your Gmail or Google Workspace inboxes
      with your appreciate account.
      <br />
      <br />
      Once your account is connected, receipts from brands and companies that we
      support are automatically added at each scan to your appreciate wallet.
      Youâ€™ll never have to remember to manually add an item or have to forward
      an email.
      <br />
      <br />
      Once authorized, import is not immediate; your inbox will be scanned
      within 24 hours.
      <br />
      <br />
      Make sure your inbox contains only recent receipt emails. When at sign up
      and connecting, appreciate will look for all receipt emails, from the last
      7 days that we support.
      <br />
      <br />
      When you setup your Gmail or Google Workspace connect account, appreciate
      never asks for or stores your password. Appreciate uses{' '}
      <span className="text-indigo cursor-pointer">OAuth</span> to authorize
      access to receipt emails from Google without ever needing your sign-in
      credentials. You can revoke OAuth access at any time, either from your
      appreciate account settings, or{' '}
      <span className="text-indigo cursor-pointer">directly from Google</span>.
